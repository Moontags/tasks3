                If statements are ideal for directing the flow of operations based on expected, verifiable conditions such as input validation and business logic decisions.
            </p>
                <p>
                On the other hand, error handling is reserved for handling unexpected or exceptional conditions, such as runtime errors or resource failures, which are not part of the routine control flow. 
                This distinction ensures clean code separation between normal operational logic and the handling of anomalies, thereby promoting robust and maintainable code.
